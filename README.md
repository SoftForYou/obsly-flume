# Flume

## Fork warnings

- This is a fork of the original Flume library by [chrisjpatty](https://github.com/chrisjpatty). Thanks for the great library!
- This fork is not maintained by the original author.
- This fork is not guaranteed to be up to date.
- We'll try to improve the functionality while maintaining the compatibility with the original library, but we can't guarantee it.

## Changes

- Be able to **duplicate your nodes**.
- Be able to use **React components** in the `label` prop of the node. Before it worked but at filtering the app crashed. Now it will try to extract the text content of the node to filter the context menu.

## Guides & Examples

## Install

```bash
npm install --save flume
```

## Usage

### Defining your nodes

Import `FlumeConfig` and use it to define the nodes and ports that will make up your node editor.

```jsx
import { FlumeConfig, Controls, Colors } from "flume";

const flumeConfig = new FlumeConfig();

flumeConfig
  .addPortType({
    type: "number",
    name: "number",
    label: "Number",
    color: Colors.red,
    controls: [
      Controls.number({
        name: "num",
        label: "Number"
      })
    ]
  })
  .addNodeType({
    type: "number",
    label: "Number",
    initialWidth: 150,
    inputs: ports => [ports.number()],
    outputs: ports => [ports.number()]
  })
  .addNodeType({
    type: "addNumbers",
    label: "Add Numbers",
    initialWidth: 150,
    inputs: ports => [
      ports.number({ name: "num1" }),
      ports.number({ name: "num2" })
    ],
    outputs: ports => [ports.number({ name: "result" })]
  });
```

### Rendering the node editor

To render the node editor, import `NodeEditor` and pass it your nodeTypes and portTypes from the configuration you created.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { NodeEditor } from "flume";
import config from "./config";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ width: 600, height: 800 }}>
      {" "}
      // Give the wrapper a width & height
      <NodeEditor nodeTypes={config.nodeTypes} portTypes={config.portTypes} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
